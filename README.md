# unique-local-ipv6

This is a guerrilla restoration of a site I found useful while deploying ULAs in my homelab, in the spirit of what makes web fun for me - discovery.

This site was made in 2013 by an unknown author. Based on historical WHOIS records, this was <i>probably</i> Manuel Badzong or another affiliate of ANDEV GMBH. The site was active for several years before eventually dying, but it amassed a small following and was cited in anything from GitHub issues to a Linux Foundation talk. The original site reconstructed from Wayback Machine archives is [here](https://github.com/tweedge/unique-local-ipv6/tree/e1ad849d232e617445f2f3a47cd43ee5da6c29cf).

This is a success story in digital preservation - even without my interaction. Keeping the logic clientside, maintaining a fairly lean list of dependencies, and avoiding UI/UX destroying crapware made this site usable even within the Wayback Machine. Even though this site was (and is) liable to disappear because it has a single owner who will eventually move on from the project or die, its days of being used to help people are not necessarily over.

As part of this restoration, I cleaned up, slapped on a favicon, deployed the site to S3/CloudFront, and rewrote the FAQ with more questions that I came across (or felt others might) when deploying IPv6 ULAs. Just about good as new.

I hope this site can now help you as it helped me, and it will be available for the forseeable future at [https://unique-local-ipv6.com/](https://unique-local-ipv6.com/).
