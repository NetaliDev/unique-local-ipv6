# unique-local-ipv6

This is a guerrilla restoration of a site I found useful while deploying ULAs in my homelab. I wrote a summary of what I've done - and why - [on my blog](https://chris.partridge.tech/2022/digital-resurrection/).

If you're interested in the original state of the site, it's available at [this commit](https://github.com/tweedge/unique-local-ipv6/tree/e1ad849d232e617445f2f3a47cd43ee5da6c29cf), though as far as forensic evidence goes I was being sloppy and had already made a few changes. So if you're *really* interested in the *truly* original site, you can pull the raw archived data from the Wayback Machine by appending `id_` to the end of the timestamp in any URL you want to fetch, for example this copy of the original homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20170602044844id_/http://unique-local-ipv6.com/

As part of this restoration, I cleaned up, removed Google Analytics, slapped on a favicon, deployed the site to S3/CloudFront, and rewrote the FAQ with more questions that I came across (or felt others might) when deploying IPv6 ULAs. Dead project, new life. I hope this site can now help you as it helped me, and it will be available for the forseeable future at [https://unique-local-ipv6.com/](https://unique-local-ipv6.com/).

For any corrections, missing content, corrections, or other issues: please feel free to file [a new issue here](https://github.com/tweedge/unique-local-ipv6/issues). Thanks!
