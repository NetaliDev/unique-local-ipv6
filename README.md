# unique-local-ipv6

This is a guerrilla restoration of a site I found useful while deploying ULAs in my homelab. I wrote a summary of what I've done - and why - [on my blog](https://chris.partridge.tech/2022/digital-resurrection/).

If you're interested in the *original* state of the site as reconstructed from Wayback Machine archives, it's available at [this commit](https://github.com/tweedge/unique-local-ipv6/tree/e1ad849d232e617445f2f3a47cd43ee5da6c29cf). As part of this restoration, I cleaned up, removed Google's tracker, slapped on a favicon, deployed the site to S3/CloudFront, and rewrote the FAQ with more questions that I came across (or felt others might) when deploying IPv6 ULAs. Dead project, new life. I hope this site can now help you as it helped me, and it will be available for the forseeable future at [https://unique-local-ipv6.com/](https://unique-local-ipv6.com/).

For any corrections, missing content, corrections, or other issues: please feel free to file [a new issue here](https://github.com/tweedge/unique-local-ipv6/issues). Thanks!
