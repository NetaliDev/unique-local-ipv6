        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This site was made in 2013 by an unknown author. Based on historical WHOIS records, this was <i>probably</i> Manuel Badzong or another affiliate of ANDEV GMBH. The site was active for several years before eventually dying. Its lifespan was preserved by the Wayback Machine with reasonable frequency:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The earliest archive on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130422102706/https://unique-local-ipv6.com/">22 April 2013</a> features this site with serverside rendering and a simpler layout.</li>
          <li>On or before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209011327/http://unique-local-ipv6.com/">9 February 2014</a> the site was updated to use Bootstrap 3 and clientside JS for generating ULAs.</li>
          <li>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209011327/http://unique-local-ipv6.com/">9 June 2017</a> the site - served by nginx on an Ubuntu server - begins throwing 404 Not Found errors.</li>
          <li>The domain registration lapses and unique-local-ipv6.com is bought by an online spammer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190808073700/http://www.unique-local-ipv6.com/">sometime in 2019</a>, who run a Wordpress site filled with SEO shit and a $5 logo. Who knew UNIQUE-LOCAL-IPV6 (subtext: unicast address format) blog would be filled with good oral sex tips?</li>
          <li>Said spammer continues filling the site with (likely autogenerated) shit at least into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200217225234/http://unique-local-ipv6.com/">February 2020</a>.</li>
          <li>Sometime in 2020-2021, the spammer lets the domain lapse. It was flagged by Google as <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/100852436/why-i-am-getting-pure-spam-manual-action-on-my-blog?hl=en&msgid=100876983">"pure spam"</a> (yes, that's really the term!) in violation of Google's Webmaster Guidelines, which lowers or removes it from Google's results. So long, SEO.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is - by and large - a success story in digital preservation, even though the Wayback Machine is now storing some unwanted and probably not-so-great tips on oral sex. Keeping the logic clientside, maintaining a fairly lean list of dependencies, and avoiding UI/UX destroying crapware made this site usable even within the Wayback Machine. Even though this site was (and is) liable to disappear because it has a single owner who will eventually move on from the project or die, its days of being used to help people are not necessarily over.
        </p>
        <p>
          While other sites for ULA generation exist, I decided to revitalize this project from the Wayback Machine. Why? Honestly, because I bothered clicking past the spam that had been most recently saved to find the original site, and it was still dang useful. Does this solve any fundamental problems with digital preservation? Am I likely to keep this site alive for my entire career? <i>Nope.</i> But I'm rolling out IPv6 across a couple networks and thought it'd be useful to me in the future, and I could correct a couple typos here and there too. Why not?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I pulled down a copy of the site from the Wayback Machine and a modified copy is now served via AWS S3 and CloudFront, so the biggest cost to me will be the yearly domain renewal fee. This restores functionality to the roughly ~100 dead links currently visible to Google pointed to it - including everything from GitHub issues, to the thread I was using to troubleshoot, to even <a href="http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ipv6-lce.pdf">slides presented at the Linux Foundation</a>. This domain will never run ads or SEO marketing garbage while it's under my control.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of the original author(s) take issue with anything I've done here, I'm happy to take the site back down, but wanted to give their work a longer lifespan. I've left the original copyright alone but would happily amend it if requested by the original author to reflect the copyright holder's name or affiliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if you <i>would</i> like to do something to solve fundamental problems with digital preservation and access to knowledge, <b>please</b> consider making a one-time or recurring <a href="https://archive.org/donate">donation</a> to the Internet Archive. It's <i>their</i> work that ensured you can read these words, or utilize this site - <i>not</i> mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this site helped you as it has helped me.
